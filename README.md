# Welcome to my Todo list and Backend project!

## How to run the server and the website in your computer.

- First download the repo to your computer.
- And now all you need to do is open the `start server and website.bat` file,the website will open and the server will automatically run in http://localhost:3000
- If you want to close the server go to the cmd window that opened when you clicked on the `start server and website.bat` file and press ctrl + c, the cmd will ask you if you want to close the server.
- Type `Y` and press enter to close the server, otherwise type `N`.

### Hope you enjoy!
